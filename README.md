Our time as a species has already past. What we experience in material
reality is like the time is takes for a sunset to be observed but arching around a 
black hole. We all already dead, but the fallen angels are trying to reconstruct what might
have happened to our civilization.

there is only eternal spirit and acting outside the necessity of God's explanation of our lives as we mutually realize them
